# D3 Calendar Heatmap
A d3 heatmap representing time series data. Inspired by Github's contribution chart

## TODO's

* Allow developers to provide the data source! No more random sample data
* Make this more modular and configurable and reusable, as per Mike Bostock's [reusable D3.js charts best practices](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/).
* Allow developers to enable/disable tooltip
* Allow editing of tooltip text
* Allow editing of the cell gradient colours
* Allow editing of the start/end dates
* I'd prefer to not have to rely on moment.js for date formatting, but it keeps the code a lot cleaner so it'll stay for now until a better solution can be found
